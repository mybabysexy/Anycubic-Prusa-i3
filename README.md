# Anycubic-Prusa-i3
Marlin 1.1.8 for acrylic Anycubic i3+ with Ultrabase

I modified pin_RAMPS.h to fit my DIY SD card extender as shown in https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853018, just change it back if you want to use the default SD card reader.

And also I enabled MESH_BED_LEVELING and LEVEL_CORNERS features to make life more easier, as well as PARK_NOZZLE and CHANGE_FILAMENT
